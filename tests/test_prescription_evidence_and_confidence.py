"""A prescription must carry the evidence behind its claims and its own certainty.

Two of the eight explanations the twin is supposed to deliver were absent from the
response contract: *what evidence supports this* and *how confident is it*.
``state_drivers`` collapsed each threshold test to a phrase and threw away the number that
fired it, and no field anywhere carried a variance, interval, or confidence band — grepping
``confidence|variance|uncertain|interval`` over app/schemas/prescription.py returned nothing.

Both were cheap because the data was already in hand: ``finalize_prescription`` receives the
whole state vector, and ``_derive_state_drivers`` already read the exact numeric behind each
label before discarding it.
